# Online Banking System, with python Flask



This is a simplified version of an online banking system, entirely with python Flask for the driver code and Html and css for the webpage design.
This includes features like:
* New Employee registration
* Existing Employee Login
* New Customer registration
* Existing Customer Login
* Money Withdraw & Deposit

<br>
For saving the employee and customer details, I have used json, instead of sql.

<br>
<br>
To run this flask app, open a linux terminal here and execute 

`export FLASK_APP=app.py` <br> `flask run`
